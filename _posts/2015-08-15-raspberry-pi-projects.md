##Project Ideas
After fiddling around with Raspberry Pis a lot during my bachelors thesis, I still am not fed up with it. There are more things I want to do with it. So here is a short list of things I want to do / try out when I finish my thesis and have some more free time.

###Music box
Many times we listen to music from our smartphones either via their built in speaker or via shitty speakers in our kitchen. The same is for listening to Youtube videos from my laptop. So I want to build a wifi speaker box with a Raspberry Pi that everyone can stream sound to from his device of choice. There are many projects around on the web, so I think this is very possible.

###Smart lamp
I want to just turn off the light with a button press on my phone and not have to get up again. Now that I have got some experience with soldering and electronics, I want to try to build something with relays and stuff. And I think it is a good possibility to learn some more about python web servers and stuff.

###NFC controlled door lock.
I life in a shared flat. So I will not change the door lock any time soon (they are not to tech interested....) but I still would like to have a door lock that I can open via an NFC chip. And I would want to have a number pad where you can enter a code to open the door. And what would be really cool was, if I could at my friends smartphones to a database and unlock the door for them if I want. Like they want to come over and I can enable their smartphone for the next 10 minutes.      
I read again about an implanted NFC chip. Even though getting something that big injected with a syringe scares the shit out of me, I still find this idea very appealing. Unlocking the smartphone only when it is in my hand. Unlocking the door with a sweet swipe of my hand....
