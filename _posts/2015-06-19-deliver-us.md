## Deliver us - In Flames

This song is one of my most favorite ones by my most favorite swedish metal band. When I first saw this video in 2011 I was amazed and stunned. This how I expected a swedish metal video to be. I mean execpt for the dark bloodthirsty and church burning videos. It shows the Sweden I know, the wonderful summer nights with the endless light. Fireworks to celebrate the nicest time of the year.

With the summer here taking a little break, I was happy to find this song again. I have watched the video like five times in a row and probably I will go on a little. And it awoke my wanderlust again...
