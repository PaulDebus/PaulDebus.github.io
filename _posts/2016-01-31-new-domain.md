## New domain active

After waiting for long and not being sure what I want, I did it last night. I got myself a domain. <pauldebus.de> was the one I got. All the others I thought about were not available. The best (of course) would have been <paul.de> but obviously I was not the first to think that. Trying to be more serious, I wanted my surname.... no luck. So I went with the combination of both.

I am starting slowly to learn about domains, right now I only use the email service provided by the domain registrar and I point the domain to this blog. Unfortunately the package I have (which is at less then 2$ per month) does not include subdomains. I will have to get a bigger package if I want this, right now I will stay with this one. Exams upcoming and stuff...

So now the official address is <pauldebus.de>, though I guess the GitHub address still works.
